Hi, I am Timothy Oh. Currently I am doing research at the University of California, Riverside. I’m interested in how intelligence can emerge as a consequence of simpler parts. 
This reflects my belief that our understanding of intelligence is best obtained through a bottom-up approach,
where we should try our best to build one, in contrast to more systematic approaches like neuronal-population averaging
and statistical abstractions.

My expertise includes machine learning, theoretical and computational neuroscience, 
neuromorphic computing, computational complexity theory, software engineering, computer architecture, 
electrical engineering, computational biology, information theory, stem cell research, 
and alternative forms of computation. 
I also have an interest in physics, with a very rudimentary understanding of general relativity and quantum field theory, 
and their applications to exciting frontiers such as nuclear fusion, quantum computing, gravitational wave detection, 
and high energy particle accelerators.

"It also ought to be noted that the language here involved may well correspond to a short code in the sense described earlier, 
rather than to a complete code: when we talk mathematics, we may be discussing a secondary language, 
built on the primary language truly used by the central nervous system. 
Thus the outward forms of our mathematics are not absolutely relevant from the 
point of view of evaluating what the mathematical or logical language truly used 
by the central nervous system is. However, the above remarks about reliability and 
logical and arithmetical depth prove that whatever the system is, it cannot fail to 
differ considerably from what we consciously and explicitly consider as mathematics."

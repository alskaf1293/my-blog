Hi, I am Timothy Oh. Currently I am doing research at the University of California, Riverside. I’m interested in how intelligence can emerge as a consequence of simpler parts. 
This reflects my belief that our understanding of intelligence is best obtained through a bottom-up approach,
where we should try our best to build one, in contrast to more systematic approaches like neuronal-population averaging
and statistical abstractions.

My expertise includes machine learning, theoretical and computational neuroscience, 
neuromorphic computing, computational complexity theory, software engineering, computer architecture, 
electrical engineering, computational biology, information theory, stem cell research, 
and alternative forms of computation. 
I also have an interest in physics, with a very rudimentary understanding of general relativity and quantum field theory, 
and their applications to exciting frontiers such as nuclear fusion, quantum computing, gravitational wave detection, 
and high energy particle accelerators.

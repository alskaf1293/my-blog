A very simple but useful relation in quantum mechanics is the so called completeness relation.
Here, I will derive it

For any $\ket{\psi}$ living in a Hilbert space, you can represent the vector as a linear combination
of some orthonormal bases

$$
\ket{\psi} = \sum_{i} c_{\alpha_i} \ket{\alpha_i}
$$

For any one of these orthonormal bases, applying the bra $\bra{\alpha_k}$ 
with the orthonormality condition $\braket{\alpha_i | \alpha_j} = \delta_{ij}$

$$
\braket{\alpha_k | \psi} = \bra{\alpha_k} (\sum_{i} c_{\alpha_i} \ket{\alpha_i})
$$

$$
\braket{\alpha_k | \psi} = c_{\alpha_k}
$$

So we can rewrite this

$$
\ket{\psi} = \sum_{i} c_{\alpha_i} \ket{\alpha_i}
$$

as

$$
\ket{\psi} = \sum_{i} \ket{\alpha_i} \braket{\alpha_i | \psi}
$$

Since $\ket{\psi}$ is arbitrary, we have

$$
\mathbb{I} = \sum_{i} \ket{\alpha_i} \bra{\alpha_i}
$$

The completeness relation. For the continuous case, you have the integral

$$
\mathbb{I} = \int da \ket{a} \bra{a}
$$
